Hello!

My name is Vincent Mills but most people just call me Vince.
I live in Richmond Virginia and I'm currently a full time technician at a motorcycle dealership and a part time student at Reynolds Community colledge pursuing an Associate of Applied Science in Information Technology. 

My focus is cloud computing and when I'm not engaged in my course work at school, I'm testing my skills on hardware in my home lab, or virtually in the cloud.
IT has become my primary hobby, but my goal is to soon transition into full-time work within the IT industry. My experience as a diagnostic mechanic has helped me develop strong critical analysis skills that I have applied to my IT studies. Additionally, I have certifications such as the CompTIA Network+ and Security+.

Thank you for stopping by and checking out my Github profile. I hope you give me a follow as I continue my education and push projects representing some of the skills I've learned. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or if you're interested in working together.

-Vince.
