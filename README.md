My name is Vincent Mills.
I live in Richmond Virginia.
I am 32 years old and currently studying for an Associate of Applied Science in Information Technology. 
I work full time as a service and repair technician at a modern motorcycle dealership but after 7 years of turning wrenches I'm ready to move into a new industry. 
I discovered I.T. in a few ways. First I needed a computer for school, so my DIY spirit forced me to build my own PC. 
Second I found myself connecting a computer everyday at work while diagnosing the embeded system on modern motorcycles. 

I've really enjoyed I.T. as a hobby, building and tearing down networks in my homelab, and constiantly tinking with raspberry pis.
But I'm ready to start focus in and sharpening my skills. 

I recently earned the Comptia Security+ certificate and I will be testing for Network+ later this month and Linux+ this fall. 
I have also began practicing Python3 to strengthen my scripting skills which will be my main focus of my Github account. 

My goal is to eventually become fluid in Python for network automation, cloud computing and where ever else the skill may take me. 

Thanks for stopping by and checking out my GitHub.
Ride safe and have fun coding.

-Vince.
